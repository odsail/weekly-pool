**Generated:** 2025-09-24 19:08:05  
**Command Used:** `python week4_contrarian_analysis.py`  
**Strategy:** Contrarian picks based on consensus failure analysis from Weeks 1-3  
**Data Source:** CBS Sports expert picks + historical consensus failure patterns

## Methodology

This week's picks use a **contrarian strategy** based on our analysis of consensus failures from Weeks 1-3:

**IMPORTANT:** We are picking the **straight-up winner** of each game, NOT covering the point spread. The spreads shown in the expert data are for reference only.

### Key Insights from Historical Analysis:
- **11 consensus failures** across 3 weeks
- **2 universal failures** where ALL 18 participants were wrong
- **3 near universal failures** where 16+ people were wrong
- **Pattern**: When everyone agrees on a pick, it's often wrong

### Contrarian Strategy:
- **HIGH RISK**: Fade universal consensus (7/7 experts)
- **MEDIUM RISK**: Fade strong consensus (6/7 experts)  
- **LOW RISK**: Fade moderate consensus (5/7 experts) or take split decisions
