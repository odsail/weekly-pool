## Risk Analysis

### 💡 LOW RISK CONTRARIAN PICKS (1 pick) - HIGHEST CONFIDENCE:
- **New Orleans Saints** vs New York Giants (16 pts) - Split decision contrarian (4/7 experts)

**Rationale**: These picks are based on split decisions. They get the highest confidence points because they're the safest contrarian plays.

### ⚠️ MEDIUM RISK CONTRARIAN PICKS (5 picks) - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE:
- **Cleveland Browns** vs Minnesota Vikings (12 pts) - Fade strong consensus (6/7 experts)
- **Baltimore Ravens** vs Houston Texans (11 pts) - Fade strong consensus (6/7 experts)
- **Tampa Bay Buccaneers** vs Seattle Seahawks (10 pts) - Fade strong consensus (6/7 experts)
- **Washington Commanders** vs Los Angeles Chargers (9 pts) - Fade strong consensus (6/7 experts)
- **Jacksonville Jaguars** vs Kansas City Chiefs (8 pts) - Fade strong consensus (6/7 experts)

**Rationale**: These games have strong expert consensus (6/7 experts). Strong consensus has historically been wrong frequently, but they're riskier than split decisions.

### 🚨 HIGH RISK CONTRARIAN PICKS (8 picks) - LOWEST CONFIDENCE:
- **San Francisco 49ers** vs Los Angeles Rams (5 pts) - Fade universal consensus (7/7 experts)
- **New York Jets** vs Dallas Cowboys (4 pts) - Fade universal consensus (7/7 experts)
- **Denver Broncos** vs Philadelphia Eagles (3 pts) - Fade universal consensus (7/7 experts)
- **Las Vegas Raiders** vs Indianapolis Colts (2 pts) - Fade universal consensus (7/7 experts)
- **Carolina Panthers** vs Miami Dolphins (1 pts) - Fade universal consensus (7/7 experts)
- **Tennessee Titans** vs Arizona Cardinals (0 pts) - Fade universal consensus (7/7 experts)
- **Cincinnati Bengals** vs Detroit Lions (-1 pts) - Fade universal consensus (7/7 experts)
- **New England Patriots** vs Buffalo Bills (-2 pts) - Fade universal consensus (7/7 experts)

**Rationale**: These games have universal expert consensus (7/7 experts). Based on our historical analysis, universal consensus often fails, but these are the riskiest contrarian plays, so they get the lowest confidence points.
