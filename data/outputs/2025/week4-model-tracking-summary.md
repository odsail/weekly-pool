# Week 4 Model Tracking Summary

**Generated:** 2025-09-25 16:41:11  
**Command Used:** `python week4_model_tracking_system.py`

## Primary Model Selection

**Selected Model:** Straight-Up Expert Consensus

### Rationale:
Straight-Up Expert Consensus chosen as primary model because:

- Most similar to successful Weeks 1-3 pattern (81.3% and 68.8% accuracy)
- Based on expert consensus which incorporates real-time factors
- Similar confidence distribution (55-85% range)
- Data-driven approach using current information
- Proven methodology that experts use successfully

## All Models Being Tracked


### Straight-Up Expert Consensus 🎯 **PRIMARY MODEL**
- **File:** `data/outputs/2025/week-week4-straight-up-consensus.md`
- **Description:** CBS Sports expert consensus for straight-up winners
- **Confidence Method:** Expert consensus strength (7/7 = 16 pts)

### Contrarian Strategy 📊 Tracking
- **File:** `data/outputs/2025/week-week4-contrarian-picks.md`
- **Description:** Contrarian picks based on consensus failure analysis
- **Confidence Method:** Risk-based (low risk = high points)

### Expert Consensus (Original) 📊 Tracking
- **File:** `data/outputs/2025/week-week4-expert-consensus.md`
- **Description:** Original expert consensus with spreads (for comparison)
- **Confidence Method:** Expert consensus strength

## Special Factors for Week 4

### International Games:
- **Week 4:** Minnesota Vikings vs Pittsburgh Steelers (both teams away from home)
- **Week 5:** Minnesota Vikings vs [opponent] (Vikings acclimated, opponent just arrived)
- **Impact:** Vikings have timezone acclimation advantage in Week 5

### Travel Considerations:
- Teams playing back-to-back international games
- Time zone changes and acclimation periods
- Home field advantage elimination for international games
- Travel fatigue and recovery time

## Tracking Goals

- Compare model accuracy week by week
- Identify which models improve over time
- Determine if contrarian strategy becomes more effective
- Adjust primary model selection based on performance
- Incorporate new factors (travel, international games, etc.)

## Post-Game Analysis Plan

1. **Immediate Analysis (Post Week 4):**
   - Calculate accuracy for each model
   - Compare to historical performance
   - Identify which factors influenced outcomes

2. **Weekly Comparison:**
   - Track model performance trends
   - Identify improving/declining models
   - Adjust primary model selection if needed

3. **Factor Analysis:**
   - Evaluate impact of international games
   - Assess travel and timezone factors
   - Incorporate new insights into future models

4. **Model Evolution:**
   - If contrarian strategy shows improvement, consider switching
   - Incorporate successful patterns into primary model
   - Continuously refine based on results
