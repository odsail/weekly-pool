**Generated:** 2025-09-25 16:40:36  
**Command Used:** `python week4_contrarian_analysis.py`  
**Strategy:** Contrarian picks based on consensus failure analysis from Weeks 1-3  
**Data Source:** CBS Sports expert picks + historical consensus failure patterns

## Methodology

This week's picks use a **contrarian strategy** based on our analysis of consensus failures from Weeks 1-3:

### Key Insights from Historical Analysis:
- **11 consensus failures** across 3 weeks
- **2 universal failures** where ALL 18 participants were wrong
- **3 near universal failures** where 16+ people were wrong
- **Pattern**: When everyone agrees on a pick, it's often wrong

### Contrarian Strategy:
- **HIGH RISK**: Fade universal consensus (7/7 experts)
- **MEDIUM RISK**: Fade strong consensus (6/7 experts)  
- **LOW RISK**: Fade moderate consensus (5/7 experts) or take split decisions

## Risk Analysis

### 💡 LOW RISK CONTRARIAN PICKS (9 picks) - HIGHEST CONFIDENCE:
- **Miami Dolphins** vs New York Jets (16 pts) - Both teams 0-3
- **Kansas City Chiefs** vs Baltimore Ravens (15 pts) - Ravens were in near universal failure
- **Atlanta Falcons** vs Washington Commanders (14 pts) - Falcons were in near universal failure
- **Houston Texans** vs Tennessee Titans (13 pts) - Both teams 0-3
- **Philadelphia Eagles** vs Tampa Bay Buccaneers (12 pts) - Eagles are 3-0
- **Cleveland Browns** vs Detroit Lions (11 pts) - Bounce back potential
- **Indianapolis Colts** vs Los Angeles Rams (10 pts) - Split decision
- **Green Bay Packers** vs Dallas Cowboys (9 pts) - Bounce back from universal failure
- **Pittsburgh Steelers** vs Minnesota Vikings (8 pts) - Carson Wentz factor

**Rationale**: These picks are based on split decisions, bounce-back potential, or moderate consensus that can be faded. They get the highest confidence points because they're the safest contrarian plays.

### ⚠️ MEDIUM RISK CONTRARIAN PICKS (5 picks) - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE:
- **Cincinnati Bengals** vs Denver Broncos (7 pts)
- **Jacksonville Jaguars** vs San Francisco 49ers (6 pts)
- **New Orleans Saints** vs Buffalo Bills (5 pts)
- **Carolina Panthers** vs New England Patriots (4 pts)
- **Arizona Cardinals** vs Seattle Seahawks (3 pts)

**Rationale**: These games have strong expert consensus (6/7 experts). Strong consensus has historically been wrong frequently, but they're riskier than split decisions.

### 🚨 HIGH RISK CONTRARIAN PICKS (2 picks) - LOWEST CONFIDENCE:
- **Las Vegas Raiders** vs Chicago Bears (2 pts)
- **New York Giants** vs Los Angeles Chargers (1 pt)

**Rationale**: These games have universal expert consensus (7/7 experts). Based on our historical analysis, universal consensus often fails, but these are the riskiest contrarian plays, so they get the lowest confidence points.
