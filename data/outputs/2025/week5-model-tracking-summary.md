# Week 5 Model Tracking Summary

**Generated:** 2025-10-02 05:47:01  
**Command Used:** `python week5_model_tracking_system.py`

## Primary Model Selection

**Selected Model:** Expert Consensus

### Rationale:
Expert Consensus chosen as primary model because:

- Based on expert consensus which incorporates real-time factors
- Similar confidence distribution to successful patterns
- Data-driven approach using current information
- Proven methodology that experts use successfully
- Incorporates Vikings international game advantage

## All Models Being Tracked


### Expert Consensus 🎯 **PRIMARY MODEL**
- **File:** `data/outputs/2025/week-week5-expert-consensus.md`
- **Description:** CBS Sports expert consensus for straight-up winners
- **Confidence Method:** Expert consensus strength (7/7 = 16 pts)

### Contrarian Strategy 📊 Tracking
- **File:** `data/outputs/2025/week-week5-contrarian-picks.md`
- **Description:** Contrarian picks based on Week 4 performance and consensus failure analysis
- **Confidence Method:** Risk-based (low risk = high points)

## Special Factors for Week 5

### 🌍 Vikings International Game Advantage:
- **Game:** Minnesota Vikings @ Cleveland Browns
- **Vikings Advantage:** Acclimated to timezone from Week 4 international game
- **Browns Disadvantage:** First international game, adjusting to timezone
- **Expert Consensus:** 6/7 experts pick Vikings
- **Recommendation:** Consider Vikings as stronger pick despite 6/7 expert consensus

### 📊 Week 4 Performance Insights:
- **Contrarian Accuracy:** 50.0% (8/16 correct)
- **Medium Risk Success:** 4/5 medium risk contrarian picks correct
- **High Risk Failure:** 0/2 high risk contrarian picks correct
- **Low Risk Mixed:** 4/9 low risk contrarian picks correct
- **Key Lesson:** Medium risk contrarian picks performed best in Week 4

### 🎯 Consensus Patterns:
- **Universal Consensus Games:** 8
- **Strong Consensus Games:** 5
- **Split Decision Games:** 1
- **Total Games:** 14

## Tracking Goals

- Compare model accuracy week by week
- Identify which models improve over time
- Determine if contrarian strategy becomes more effective
- Adjust primary model selection based on performance
- Incorporate new factors (travel, international games, etc.)

## Post-Game Analysis Plan

1. **Immediate Analysis (Post Week 5):**
   - Calculate accuracy for each model
   - Compare to Week 4 performance
   - Evaluate Vikings international advantage impact
   - Identify which factors influenced outcomes

2. **Weekly Comparison:**
   - Track model performance trends
   - Identify improving/declining models
   - Adjust primary model selection if needed

3. **Factor Analysis:**
   - Evaluate impact of Vikings international advantage
   - Assess contrarian strategy effectiveness
   - Incorporate new insights into future models

4. **Model Evolution:**
   - If contrarian strategy shows improvement, consider switching
   - Incorporate successful patterns into primary model
   - Continuously refine based on results

## Key Week 5 Considerations

### Vikings International Advantage:
- **Week 4**: Vikings played international game (both teams away from home)
- **Week 5**: Vikings have acclimation advantage, Browns adjusting to timezone
- **Impact**: Consider Vikings as stronger pick despite 6/7 expert consensus

### Contrarian Strategy Learning:
- **Week 4 Performance**: 50.0% accuracy (8/16 correct)
- **Best Performing**: Medium risk contrarian picks (4/5 correct)
- **Worst Performing**: High risk contrarian picks (0/2 correct)
- **Strategy**: Focus on medium risk contrarian opportunities
